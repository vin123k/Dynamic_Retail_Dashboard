# Dynamic Retail Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a dynamic retail dashboard using Microsoft Excel, designed to visualize and analyze retail sales data across various dimensions. The dashboard connects to three main data tables‚Äî**Orders**, **Returns**, and **People**‚Äîand helps businesses gain insights into key sales performance metrics. This project is ideal for businesses looking to enhance their decision-making processes by analyzing data through dynamic visualizations and KPIs.

The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) that track important metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Quantity Sold**, **Number of Orders**, and **Profit Margin**. These KPIs are calculated and displayed on a centralized chart to ensure easy comparison and visualization. The project covers multiple problem statements that help break down the data into actionable insights.
